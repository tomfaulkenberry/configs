# configs

This is a simple collection of RC and config files for my email setup.  It assumes the following are installed:

- offlineimap (~brew install offlineimap~) - used to clone Gmail to local computer
- msmtp (~brew install msmtp~) - used for sending mail
- neomutt (~brew install neomutt/homebrew-neomutt/neomutt~) - my email client
